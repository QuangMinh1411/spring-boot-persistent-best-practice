How To Efficiently Assign A Database Temporary Sequence Of Values To Rows

If you prefer to read it as a blog-post containing the relevant snippets of code then check this post

Description: This application is an example of assigning a database temporary sequence of values to rows via the window function, ROW_NUMBER(). This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

Key points:

commonly, you don't need to fetch in the result set the temporary sequence of values produced by ROW_NUMBER() (you will use it internally, in the query, usually in the WHERE clause and CTEs), but, this time, let's write a Spring projection (DTO) that contains a getter for the column generated by ROW_NUMBERas well
write several native querys relying on ROW_NUMBER() window function

How To Efficiently Assign A Database Temporary Ranking Of Values To Rows via RANK()

Description: This application is an example of assigning a database temporary ranking of values to rows via the window function, RANK(). This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

How To Efficiently Distribute The Number Of Rows In The Specified (N) Number Of Groups Via NTILE(N)

Description: This application is an example of distributing the number of rows in the specified (N) number of groups via the window function, NTILE(N). This window function is available in almost all databases, and starting with version 8.x is available in MySQL as well.

Key points:

commonly, you don't need to fetch in the result set the temporary ranking of values produced by NTILE() (you will use it internally, in the query, usually in the WHERE clause and CTEs), but, this time, let's write a Spring projection (DTO) that contains a getter for the column generated by NTILE() as well
